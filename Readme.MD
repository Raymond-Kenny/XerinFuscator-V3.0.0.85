# XerinFuscator v3.0.0.85
Yeah so this is barely a source leak if anything 
almost everything is renamed so you probably wont understand much
UI has a couple of isssues such as missing mostr of the support for virtualization but can be ported back if you want it enough
building is very annoying since you manually have to move the dlls around didnt bother with editing every .csproj
if you want to you can fork and fix what's here but I just did this because I was bored and wanted to make it compile and at least do it's main protections outside of virtualization
